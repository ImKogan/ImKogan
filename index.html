For those who use the NYC subway on a daily basis, it is hard not to wonder how a city as wealthy and prosperous as NYC can not solve its public transportation problems. When compared to many other cities around the world, the contrast is even starker, and not in favor of NYC. As NYC Subway usage has reached new peaks this decade, the state of the Subway has become more of a focal point. My initial motivation for this project stemmed from reading performance statistics published by the MTA <a href=http://dashboard.mta.info/>http://dashboard.mta.info/</a> and local news sources. I wanted to know how some of these metrics are determined. This project is an attempt to answer these questions.

<a href=https://github.com/ImKogan/MTA2014>MTA2014</a> uses historical NYC Subway data from 2014.
