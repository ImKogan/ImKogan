    <p>I use this page to maintain links to past projects and current work. My main language tool is Python. In prior roles as a fullstack developer, I have used Django/POstgreSQL extensively. I currently use Pandas extensively.</p>
    <p>In April I started a 3 months course with <a href=https://theaiinstitute.ai/>The AI Institute</a>. It is an intensive hands on course in the use of modern statistical tools, deep learning and big data understanding. I am focusing on NLP techniques and applications. Academically my background (masters degree) is in mathematics and I enjoy data analysis/visualization as well as continuing my mathematical education, with a current focus on Bayesian modeling.</p>
